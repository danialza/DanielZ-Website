## Why this matters

When internet access in Iran is limited or unstable, each volunteer node can make a real difference.

**Psiphon Conduit** is an open-source tool that turns your device into a bridge. This helps some users in Iran connect to a more open internet.

## What Psiphon Conduit does

- Iran has one of the largest Psiphon user bases globally.
- Open Source: A secure and transparent system.
- You can adjust the bandwidth usage at any time.
- Since it consumes battery and data, it is best to run it on a PC/Laptop with unlimited internet.
- The system routes help where it is needed most; you do not choose the destination.

## What you need before running it

- A PC or laptop that can stay online for long hours.
- Stable internet, ideally with a high or unlimited data plan.
- Awareness that it will use power and data during operation.

## Note for users in Iran

Connecting from inside Iran usually requires Psiphon, and it may take patience, especially during heavy filtering.

## Final thought

Free internet is a right, not a privilege.

If you can, running a Conduit station is a practical way to help.
