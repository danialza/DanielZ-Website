Hi, I'm a starter Astro. I'm particularly great for getting you started with your own blogging website.

## Features

Here are my some of my awesome built in features:

- I'm ultra fast as I'm a static site
- I'm fully responsive
- I come with a light and dark mode
- I'm easy to customise and add additional content
- I have Tailwind CSS styling
- Shiki code syntax highlighting
- Satori for auto generating OG images for blog posts
